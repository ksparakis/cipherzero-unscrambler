##Introduction

Iâ€™ve been a big fan of a lot of the affects used in the watchdogs video game promotional material. One of my favorite things is a word unscramble. If you head over to their website you can see this when first loading. And so I sat down and gave it my best attempt at reproducing those results in javascript!
